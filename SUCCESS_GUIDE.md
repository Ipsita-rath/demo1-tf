# ✅ SUCCESS! Your Project is Running

## What's Working Now

Based on the logs, your Terraform Automation System is now running successfully:

- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on `http://localhost:5000`  
- ✅ **tsx**: Successfully installed and working
- ✅ **Environment**: Set to development mode

## Next Steps

### 1. Access the Frontend
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. What You'll See
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Azure resource designer canvas
- **Resource Sidebar**: Categorized Azure resources (Security, Storage, Networking, etc.)
- **Global Information Button**: Configure subscription, resource groups, and tags
- **Landing Zone Options**: Pre-configured AI Studio and Application environments

### 3. How to Use the System

#### Basic Workflow:
1. **Select a Landing Zone** (optional):
   - Click the landing zone dropdown in the sidebar
   - Choose "AI Studio Landing Zone" or "Application Zone"
   - This pre-populates the canvas with related resources

2. **Drag Resources to Canvas**:
   - Browse resources in the sidebar (use search if needed)
   - Drag any Azure resource onto the canvas
   - Resources automatically organize into Resource Groups

3. **Configure Resources**:
   - Click on any resource to open its configuration panel
   - Fill in Azure-specific settings (SKUs, regions, sizes, etc.)
   - Set up dependencies and connections

4. **Set Global Information**:
   - Click "Global Information" button in the header
   - Configure subscription details, resource groups, and tags
   - This applies settings to all resources at once

5. **Generate Terraform Code**:
   - Click "Preview Code" to see the generated Terraform
   - View deployment logs and validation results
   - Download or deploy the configuration

## Available Features

### Resource Types (20+ supported):
- **Security**: Key Vault, Managed Identity, Role Assignments
- **Networking**: Virtual Networks, Subnets, NSGs
- **Compute**: Virtual Machines, App Services, Functions
- **Storage**: Storage Accounts, Cosmos DB, Redis
- **AI/ML**: AI Studio, OpenAI Services, Application Insights
- **Database**: SQL Database, Cosmos DB
- **Integration**: API Management, Event Hub, Private Endpoints

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Code Generation**: Terraform code updates as you design
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Subscription → Resource Groups → Services structure
- **Comprehensive Configuration**: Azure-specific settings for each resource
- **Tag Management**: Organize resources with custom labels
- **Landing Zone Templates**: Pre-configured environments
- **Terraform Cloud Integration**: Deploy directly to Terraform Cloud

## Files Created for You

I've created several helper files for easy development:

- `install-and-run.bat` - One-click Windows setup
- `quick-start.js` - Universal starter script
- `dev-server.js` - Cross-platform development server
- `simple-start.js` - Fallback starter
- `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` - Windows-specific instructions
- `LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

## Running the Project

For future runs, you can now simply use:
```cmd
node quick-start.js
```

Or the original method:
```cmd
tsx server/index.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Server not starting**: Check that tsx is installed globally
2. **Port conflicts**: Change port in `server/index.ts`
3. **Frontend not loading**: Ensure both servers are running
4. **Database errors**: Use in-memory storage (default) for testing

## Enjoy Your Terraform Automation System!

You now have a fully functional infrastructure design platform. Start by exploring the pre-configured Landing Zones or drag individual resources to build your own Azure architecture!
