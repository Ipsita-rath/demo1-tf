# Terraform Automation System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for automating Azure resource creation using Terraform through a drag-and-drop UI interface. The system allows users to visually design Azure infrastructure by dragging components onto a canvas, configure them through dynamic forms, and generate Terraform code that can be deployed through Terraform Cloud integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
